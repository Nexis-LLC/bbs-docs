# DB Sharding & Replication

This document outlines best practices for implementing database sharding and replication in a scalable Spring Boot architecture.

---

## 1. Overview

Sharding and replication allow the system to scale horizontally and improve availability. Sharding splits data across nodes; replication ensures fault tolerance and read scalability.

---

## 2. Sharding

### What is Sharding?

- Partitioning data into smaller, faster, more manageable parts.
- Each shard handles a subset of data (e.g., by tenant ID or user ID).

### Strategies

- **Hash-based sharding**: Evenly distributes data, but limits range queries.
- **Range-based sharding**: Efficient for queries on time or numeric ranges.
- **Directory-based sharding**: Central map that routes to the correct shard.

### Implementation

- Use sharding middleware (e.g., **ShardingSphere**, **Vitess**).
- Use separate `DataSource` beans per shard in Spring Boot.
- Route based on a key using `AbstractRoutingDataSource`.

## 3. Replication

### Primary-Replica

- Writes go to the primary DB.
- Reads are routed to one of many replicas.

### Spring Boot Setup

- Use `AbstractRoutingDataSource` for read/write separation.
- Combine with tools like **PgBouncer** or **ProxySQL**.

### Failover

- Use health checks to reroute traffic if primary fails.
- Automate with **Patroni** (Postgres), **Orchestrator** (MySQL).

## 4. Challenges

- **Consistency**: Use eventual consistency models for reads.
- **Transaction boundaries**: Avoid cross-shard transactions.
- **Join limitations**: Denormalize data if joins cross shards.

---

## 5. Monitoring & Maintenance

- Track replication lag via Prometheus exporters.
- Monitor shard growth and rebalancing needs.
