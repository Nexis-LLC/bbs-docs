##   Project Overview

The Bus Ticket Booking System addresses the challenges of modern bus operations by providing:

* **High Availability:** Ensures continuous booking services even during peak demand.
* **Scalability:** Dynamically adjusts to varying traffic loads.
* **Fault Tolerance:** Recovers quickly from failures to minimize downtime.
* **Secure Transactions:** Protects user data and payment information.

This system leverages a modern tech stack, including Java/Spring Boot, Kafka, and Kubernetes, to deliver a robust and efficient booking experience for both travelers and bus operators.

##   Key Features

* **Real-Time Seat Management:** Provides up-to-the-minute seat availability and prevents overbooking.
* **Resilient Payment Processing:** Integrates secure payment gateways with robust transaction handling.
* **Automated Scaling:** Utilizes Kubernetes to automatically adjust resources based on demand.
* **Comprehensive Observability:** Offers detailed monitoring and logging for proactive issue detection.

##   Architecture

The system is designed using a microservices architecture with the following key components:

* **Microservices:** Developed with Spring Boot for specific business functions (e.g., booking, payment).
* **Event Streaming:** Kafka for asynchronous communication and data consistency.
* **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes for deployment, scaling, and management.
* **Data Storage:** PostgreSQL for persistent data and Redis for caching.
